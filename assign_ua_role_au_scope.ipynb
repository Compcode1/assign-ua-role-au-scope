    "**Assign User Administrator Role at AU Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "To support departmental autonomy, we need to delegate user management permissions within a specific division of the organization—Marketing—without granting global directory rights. This is done by assigning the built-in User Administrator role scoped to the Marketing Administrative Unit (AU). This ensures that the delegated admin can manage users only within their department, preserving governance and containment boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Action Flow (Simulated)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Identity → Administrative Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Marketing AU → Roles and administrators\n",
    "\n",
    "Click User Administrator\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Add assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Select user: aurelia.lee@company.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm scope: Marketing (not directory-wide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Assign\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: User aurelia.lee@company.com is now assigned the User Administrator role scoped only to the Marketing AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entra Control Stack Mapping**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 1 – Authority Definition**\n",
    "✅ Touched\n",
    "The action is performed by a Global Administrator or a Privileged Role Administrator who has the authority to assign roles. Role assignment audit logs are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 2 – Scope Boundaries**\n",
    "✅ Primary control layer\n",
    "This project directly engages scope limitation by assigning the User Administrator role only within the Marketing AU. This enforces strong boundary controls and is central to least-privilege governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3 – Test Identity Validation**\n",
    "✅ Essential follow-up\n",
    "After assignment, validate effective permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm that aurelia.lee can reset passwords for Marketing users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempt to access users outside the AU; access should be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally use **Microsoft Graph** or **Entra Portal** to simulate and verify role behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 4 – External Entry Controls**\n",
    "❌ Not affected\n",
    "This action applies to internal user role scoping and does not involve external or B2B identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 5 – Privilege Channels**\n",
    "✅ Moderate control activation\n",
    "A privileged role (User Administrator) is granted in a scoped and minimized way. The privilege channel is opened only within a defined boundary, reducing global risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 6 – Device Trust Enforcement**\n",
    "❌ Not affected\n",
    "This project does not intersect with device compliance or enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 7 – Continuous Verification**\n",
    "✅ Post-assignment hygiene\n",
    "Monitor sign-ins and role activity for aurelia.lee\n",
    "Add this assignment to periodic access review cycles\n",
    "Ensure the scope remains limited to the intended AU and is not elevated over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations and Follow-Up**\n",
    "Scoped role assignment was successful; access is limited to the Marketing AU.\n",
    "Attempted access to users in other departments was denied, confirming correct enforcement.\n",
    "Audit logs reflect the role assignment and any subsequent actions by aurelia.lee.\n",
    "Recommend this AU-based delegation model be used broadly to segment admin rights by department or geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entra Control Stack: Micro-Project Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "This series simulates small but common identity tasks in Microsoft Entra ID, each mapped directly to the Entra Control Stack, a seven-layer operational governance model. The projects are intentionally narrow in scope to build muscle memory in tenant navigation, access governance, and control layer mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each facsimile project follows the principle of real-world simulation—steps are written as if executed live in the Azure portal, and each task is evaluated across the seven layers of the Entra Control Stack. Unaffected layers are explicitly noted to reinforce boundary understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "• ✅ Project 1 – Add a New Guest User\n",
    "Action: Invite an external B2B user to the tenant\n",
    "Why: Exercises external collaboration policy, guest access review, and audit confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "• ✅ Project 2 – Change a Global Administrator to a Privileged Role Administrator\n",
    "Action: Replace Global Admin role with delegated Privileged Role Admin\n",
    "Why: Promotes least-privilege governance and delegation of sensitive permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "• ✅ Project 3 – Assign User Administrator Role at AU Scope\n",
    "Action: Assign User Administrator role scoped to a specific Administrative Unit\n",
